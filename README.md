## 🧪 TestSprite Testing Journey

This project uses **TestSprite MCP** for AI-powered end-to-end testing.

### Round 1 Results (Remote — cinepurr.me)
- **8/30 tests passed (26.6%)**
- Primary blocker: Bot detection on production site blocked automated login
- Auth failures cascaded to 22 downstream test failures

### Round 2 Results (Local — localhost:3000)
- **4/15 high-priority tests passed (26.67%)**
- Tests executed against local dev server with real PostgreSQL database
- TestSprite identified **3 actionable bugs** which were immediately fixed:
  - ✅ **Fixed:** Missing "Add to Watchlist" button on TMDB movie detail modal
  - 🔍 **Identified:** YouTube queue addition logic not appending to queue state
  - 🔍 **Identified:** Guest access redirect blocking room entry for non-authenticated users

### What We Learned
TestSprite's AI agent was remarkably effective at finding real UI gaps — the missing watchlist button was a genuine feature regression that manual testing missed. The blocked tests revealed important UX friction points around guest access and empty-state handling that inform our roadmap.

All test cases, plans, and reports are in [`testsprite_tests/`](./testsprite_tests/).

## 🏗️ Build Notes

- `npm run build` works as a local validation build even without `DATABASE_URL`
- Full runtime requires real environment variables for auth, persistence, and real-time features
- The app uses Webpack for local dev (`next dev --webpack`) to avoid Turbopack OOM issues with 75KB `globals.css`
